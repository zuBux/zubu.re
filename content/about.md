Hi,

I'm Paris, recovering pentester and InfoSec enthusiast. I like breaking things and figuring out ways to help people make them better. Breaking mostly happens with Python, building with Go. Lately I find myself interested in exotic things like functional programming.

On my spare computer time I hunt for bugs in open source projects, build security related tools and try to figure out whether a tech apocalypse is inevitable. When the weather is good I try to be on my bicycle. Also, gamer and electronics enthusiast.

In 2013 I co-founded Project Zero (Google's awesome Project Zero made its appearance around 2014) where I worked as a IT Security consultant until 2016.

Last time I checked, I was an Application Security Engineer at [Riot Games](http://www.riotgames.com/).
